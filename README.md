# unmenu

It's a fork of https://github.com/oNaiPs/dmenu-mac

- Fixed https://github.com/oNaiPs/dmenu-mac/issues/41
- Switched to Accessibility API

- Better (in my opinion) fuzzy matching using https://crates.io/crates/fuzzy-matcher

- Added config file at ~/.config/dmenu/config
- Allow to change the search directories
- Allow to remove apps via filters
- Allow to add scripts and aliases
